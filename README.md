# JavaScript Learning Journey

This repo contains my daily JavaScript practice as I learn the language from scratch.  
I am sharing my journey publicly to stay accountable and track my progress.

## Day-wise Progress
- **Day 01:** Variables (`var`, `let`, `const`) â†’ [View Code](./Day-01/variables.js)

## Goal
To master JavaScript, then move on to React, Node.js, and MongoDB, and eventually get a job as a MERN Stack Developer in a top company.
